# PROJECT REPORT
# FINDING CRITICAL USERS IN SOCIAL COMMUNITIES

Objective: This project aimed to leverage machine learning and data science techniques to identify critical users within social networks, crucial for understanding community dynamics and influence propagation. By pinpointing influential users, the goal was to enhance strategic decision-making in community management and social media engagement.

Approach: We implemented graph convolutional networks (GCNs), a cutting-edge deep learning technique suitable for analyzing complex relational data like social graphs. GCNs allowed us to capture the structural properties of social networks, focusing on user interactions, network centrality metrics, and influence propagation dynamics.

Team Collaboration:
•	Member A (Machine Learning Specialist): Spearheaded the implementation and optimization of GCNs, adapting advanced machine learning algorithms to effectively model and predict user influence within social graphs.
•	Member B (Data Preprocessing Expert): Led comprehensive data preprocessing efforts, including data cleaning, transformation, and feature engineering. They ensured the quality and integrity of the social network data, essential for robust model training and evaluation.
•	Member C (Model Evaluation and Metrics Lead): Directed the evaluation of the GCN model's efficacy using rigorous metrics such as node centrality measures (e.g., degree centrality, betweenness centrality) and community detection techniques. Their role was crucial in validating the model's ability to accurately identify critical users and evaluate its performance against baseline metrics.
Methodology: Data preprocessing involved:
•	Cleaning and structuring social network data to remove noise and ensure consistency.
•	Feature extraction and engineering to capture relevant user interactions and network attributes.
Model development included:
•	Training GCNs on preprocessed data to learn the hierarchical representations of users and their relationships.
•	Evaluating model performance on various metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score to assess its effectiveness in identifying critical users.

Results: The project successfully developed a GCN-based model capable of accurately identifying critical users based on their influence within social communities. Evaluation metrics indicated robust performance, with the model demonstrating significant improvements in identifying influential nodes compared to traditional centrality measures.

Conclusion: By identifying critical users, our approach provides valuable insights into community dynamics, facilitating targeted strategies for engagement and influence within social networks. The application of GCNs proved effective in capturing nuanced relationships and influence patterns, offering a powerful tool for community managers and social media analysts.

Future Directions: Future work could explore:
•	Scaling the model to handle larger and more diverse social network datasets for broader applicability.
•	Enhancing model interpretability to provide actionable insights for community management and strategic decision-making.
•	Integrating real-time data streams and dynamic network updates to adapt to evolving community dynamics.
